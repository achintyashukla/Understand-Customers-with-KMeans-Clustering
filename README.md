# Understand Customers with KMeans Clustering

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and understanding customer behavior using KMeans Clustering. We leverage the **Online Retail II** dataset, which contains transactions for a UK-based online retailer. The aim is to segment customers into meaningful clusters for better insights and business strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) and includes transactions between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The retailer specializes in unique, all-occasion giftware, and many of its customers are wholesalers.

### Features
- **InvoiceNo**: A 6-digit number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If prefixed with 'C', the transaction was a cancellation.
- **StockCode**: A 5-digit code uniquely identifying each product.
- **Description**: The product name.
- **Quantity**: Number of items purchased per transaction.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product in sterling (Â£).
- **CustomerID**: A unique 5-digit identifier for each customer.
- **Country**: Country where the customer resides.

### Missing Values
The dataset contains some missing values, particularly in the **CustomerID** and **Description** columns, which may require handling during preprocessing.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. By doing so, we aim to:
- Identify groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors.
- Gain insights into customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- Help businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Cleaning and transforming features for analysis
   - Normalizing or scaling features if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding the distribution of key features
   - Visualizing data to identify potential patterns or trends

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating relevant features such as total spend, frequency of purchases, etc., for clustering

4. **KMeans Clustering**
   - Applying the KMeans algorithm to segment customers
   - Using techniques like the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

5. **Cluster Analysis**
   - Interpreting and visualizing the resulting customer clusters
   - Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster for actionable insights

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:achintyashukla/Understand-Customers-with-KMeans-Clustering.git
   ```
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the online_retail_data_clustring.ipynb**

## Future Improvements
- **Model Tuning:** Experimenting with other clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Using techniques like PCA to improve clustering performance.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Building an interactive dashboard for better visualization and analysis of customer segments.
